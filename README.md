# Color Tracking Project with STM32, Spin Parallax Board, and Pixicam2

## Overview

This project utilizes the STM32 microcontroller, Spin Parallax Board, and Pixicam2 to implement a color tracking system. The system is designed to detect and follow a specified color using Pixicam2's camera input, and the control logic is implemented on the STM32 microcontroller.
